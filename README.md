## IDIOT scripts/programs
### aik.py
Use for interfacing with Dr. Dietz's AIK cgi. Usage:

`echo "filename" | ./aik.py`

### build.sh
Use for building all idiot programs in the directory. Creates .data.vmem and
.text.vmem Usage:

`./build.sh`

The .gitignore will prevent the vmem's from being added to the repo.

### idiocc.c
Dr. Dietz's compiler with a small fix. His was not appending a label with
an underscore and therefore generating programs that cannot be run.
